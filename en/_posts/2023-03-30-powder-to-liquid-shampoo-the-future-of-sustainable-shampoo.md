#### The format: environmental impact and ease of use.

**Reduction of waste:** UK throws away 520 million bottles of shampoo every year. Plastic bottles of hygiene products are one of the main sources of plastic waste in the world. By choosing a tablet shampoo, you significantly reduce the amount of plastic waste you produce.

**Economical:** Tablet shampoos are often cheaper to buy than traditional bottled shampoos. Although the refillable bottle may have a higher initial cost, in the long run you will save money by buying tablet shampoo refills rather than new plastic bottles.

**Practical:** Tablet shampoos are compact and easy to store.

**Easier to use than shampoo bar:** Shampoo bar is also a good sustainable alternative but it is more difficult to keep it in good condition in a shower or at the edge of a bathtub than in the form of a bottle.

#### Why is it important to choose cosmetic products based on natural ingredients or of natural origin?

**A natural ingredient** is a product of vegetable, animal or mineral origin, which is not transformed, except by traditional mechanical actions.

**An ingredient of natural origin** has undergone a chemical transformation of small scale and in limited number.

In both cases, these are not ingredients derived from petrochemicals.

**These formulas have many advantages...**

**Gentler on hair:** Natural ingredients, such as essential oils, plant extracts, and carrier oils, are often gentler on hair than synthetic ingredients. Natural shampoos can help maintain hair's natural moisture, while gently cleansing.

**Fewer harmful chemicals:** Traditional shampoos often contain chemicals such as sulfates, parabens and silicones, which can be harmful to your health. Natural shampoos generally avoid these chemicals and are therefore less harmful to the hair and scalp.

**Environmentally Friendly:** Natural ingredients are often grown sustainably and ecologically, without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Natural shampoos therefore have a reduced environmental impact compared to traditional shampoos.

**Natural scents:** Natural shampoos often use natural scents such as essential oils, which can have health benefits in addition to their pleasant scent. Synthetic fragrances used in traditional shampoos may contain harmful chemicals.

**Better for people with sensitive skin:** Natural ingredients may be more gentle for people with sensitive or allergy-prone skin. Natural shampoos can help avoid allergic reactions and skin irritations.
