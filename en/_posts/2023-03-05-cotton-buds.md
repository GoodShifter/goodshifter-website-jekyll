Using reusable cotton rounds has several advantages over using disposable ones. Here are some reasons why it's better to use reusable cotton rounds:

1. Environmentally friendly: Reusable cotton rounds are an eco-friendly option as they reduce waste compared to disposable cotton rounds. Disposable cotton rounds are often made from non-biodegradable materials and contribute to environmental pollution.
2. Cost-effective: While reusable cotton rounds may have a higher upfront cost, they are cost-effective in the long run as they can be used multiple times before needing to be replaced. This saves you money over time as you don't have to keep buying new cotton rounds.
3. Gentle on skin: Reusable cotton rounds are often made from soft and gentle materials, such as organic cotton, which can be more gentle on the skin compared to disposable ones.
4. Versatile: Reusable cotton rounds can be used for a variety of purposes, such as removing makeup, applying toner or serum, or even as a general cleaning cloth. This makes them a versatile option that can replace multiple single-use products.

Overall, using reusable cotton rounds is a more sustainable, cost-effective, and gentle option for your skincare routine.
