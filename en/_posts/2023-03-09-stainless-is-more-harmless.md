Using stainless steel pans over non-stick pans has several advantages :

1. Durability: Stainless steel pans are more durable and long-lasting than non-stick pans. They are resistant to scratches and can withstand high temperatures without warping or degrading. This means that they can be used for years without needing to be replaced.
2. Safety: Non-stick pans are coated with a synthetic material called polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which can release toxic fumes when heated to high temperatures. Stainless steel pans, on the other hand, are made of a natural material and do not contain any harmful chemicals that can leach into your food.
3. Versatility: Stainless steel pans are versatile and can be used for a wide range of cooking methods, such as sautéing, frying, boiling, and roasting. They can also be used in the oven or on a grill, making them a versatile tool in the kitchen.
4. Browning: Stainless steel pans are better at browning food than non-stick pans. This is because they conduct heat more evenly and have a better surface area for caramelization. This means that you can achieve a crispy crust on meats and vegetables, which can enhance the flavor and texture of your dishes.
5. Easy to clean: Stainless steel pans are easy to clean and maintain. They can be washed with soap and water and are dishwasher safe. They also do not require any special cleaning tools or materials, unlike non-stick pans, which require gentle cleaning to avoid damaging the non-stick coating.

Overall, using stainless steel pans is a better choice than non-stick pans because they are more durable, safe, versatile, better at browning, and easy to clean. While non-stick pans may seem more convenient, their synthetic coatings can pose health risks and their limited lifespan means they need to be.
