GoodShifter is a company with a mission to promote more sustainable and healthier consumption habits through the development of online tools (coming soon).

Hyacinthe and Ashley are the co-founders of GoodShifter.

> When I discovered the documentary â€œThe True Cost", I realized the social and environmental impact that everyday purchases can have. I then wanted to change my own consumption habits and I realized how difficult it was to do consistently and over time. This is how I started thinking about tools that would help consumers change their buying behaviours for their health and for the planet.

> In 2021, after working 10 years in marketing and in business development in France and the UK, I applied and joined the On-Purpose program in London to learn about social and environmental governance and to find the resources that would allow me to develop an app that helps sustainable consumption.
